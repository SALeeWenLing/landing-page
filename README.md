# Landing Page Project

## Languages Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML

## Aim of Project

Use JavaScript to create a dynamic navigation bar that scrolls to each selected section of a web page and highlights the section currently in the Viewport.  

## Description

The landing page is fully customisable and allows the user to navigate to each section of the page by clicking the links in the Navigation Bar.
On the backend, the section of the page that is in the Viewport is dynamically given the class "your-active-class", and the corresponding Navigation Bar Item is given the class "active". This is linked to the CSS, in which the styles for the "active" state are determined. 
A smooth scrolling effect was also added to smootly scroll to each selected section.
